I work as a senior consultant specializing in all things Microsoft Power Platform. 

My journey into Microsoft Power Platform actually started by accident. I was managing a branch in a rental car company and continuosly trying to enhance our processes and thinking of opportunities for automation. In that quest I stumbled upon Microsoft Power Platform. I created applications and automations as a citizen developer - until I was given an opportunity to make this a career.

I'm especially interested in business development and the effect low/no-code platforms, such as Microsoft Power Platform, will have in businesses in all sectors. There is a huge potential in [fusion development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/fusion-development) - utilizing low-code where possible and enhancing the platforms with pro-code.

Fusion development is something I'm working to master continuosly. I do not have formal training in any programming language, rather I've self taught what I know.

Welcome to follow me on my journey, while I learn and try to share that knowledge!
